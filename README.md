Colours4Web-Pascal
==================

Windows application to generate 'web safe' colors.

Developed with Borland Delphi 6, seemingly 8 years ago, on March 3rd and 4th, 2005. Everything in the directory, minus the built executable and backup files were committed, but I'm not 100% that it'll build. Good luck.

Crikey.
